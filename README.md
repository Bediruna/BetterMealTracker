# Better Meal Tracker

A simple, minimal meal tracker built for speed and ease of use. I created this app out of frustration with the reporting and tracking experience in apps like FatSecret and MyFitnessPal.

This tracker uses **USDA Food Data** and **Open Food Facts** to search nutritional info, with commonly used foods cached locally in **SQLite** for fast, offline-friendly access. It's designed to prioritize quick logging and clean reporting without clutter or unnecessary features.

**Note:** This app is still in active development and not yet feature-complete.
